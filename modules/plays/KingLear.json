Twice then the trumpets sounded,\n","And there I left him tranc'd.\n","*Duke of Albany.* But who was this?\n ","*Edgar.* Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise\n","Followed his enemy king and did him service\n","Improper for a slave.\n","*Gentleman.* Help, help! O, help!\n ","*Edgar.* What kind of help?\n","*Duke of Albany.* Speak, man.\n","*Edgar.* What means that bloody knife?\n","*Gentleman.* 'Tis hot, it smokes.\n","It came even from the heart of- O! she's dead!\n ","*Duke of Albany.* Who dead? Speak, man.\n","*Gentleman.* Your lady, sir, your lady! and her sister\n","By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.\n","*Edmund.* I was contracted to them both. All three\n","Now marry in an instant.\n ","*Edgar.* Here comes Kent.\n","*Duke of Albany.* Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead.\n","                                   _[Exit Gentleman.]_\n","This judgement of the heavens, that makes us tremble\n ","Touches us not with pity. O, is this he?\n","The time will not allow the compliment\n","That very manners urges.\n","*Earl of Kent.* I am come\n","To bid my king and master aye good night.\n ","Is he not here?\n","*Duke of Albany.* Great thing of us forgot!\n","Speak, Edmund, where's the King? and where's Cordelia?\n","     _[The bodies of Goneril and Regan are brought in.]_\n","Seest thou this object, Kent?\n ","*Earl of Kent.* Alack, why thus?\n","*Edmund.* Yet Edmund was belov'd.\n","The one the other poisoned for my sake,\n","And after slew herself.\n","*Duke of Albany.* Even so. Cover their faces.\n ","*Edmund.* I pant for life. Some good I mean to do,\n","Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send\n","(Be brief in't) to the castle; for my writ\n","Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia.\n","Nay, send in time.\n ","*Duke of Albany.* Run, run, O, run!\n","*Edgar.* To who, my lord? Who has the office? Send\n","Thy token of reprieve.\n","*Edmund.* Well thought on. Take my sword;\n","Give it the Captain.\n ","*Duke of Albany.* Haste thee for thy life. _[Exit Edgar.]_\n","*Edmund.* He hath commission from thy wife and me\n","To hang Cordelia in the prison and\n","To lay the blame upon her own despair\n","That she fordid herself.\n ","*Duke of Albany.* The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.\n","*Lear.* Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stone.\n","Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so\n ","That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!\n","I know when one is dead, and when one lives.\n","She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking glass.\n","If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,\n","Why, then she lives.\n ","*Earl of Kent.* Is this the promis'd end?\n","*Edgar.* Or image of that horror?\n","*Duke of Albany.* Fall and cease!\n","*Lear.* This feather stirs; she lives! If it be so,\n","It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows\n ","That ever I have felt.\n","*Earl of Kent.* O my good master!\n","*Lear.* Prithee away!\n","*Edgar.* 'Tis noble Kent, your friend.\n","*Lear.* A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!\n ","I might have sav'd her; now she's gone for ever!\n","Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!\n","What is't thou say'st, Her voice was ever soft,\n","Gentle, and low- an excellent thing in woman.\n","I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.\n ","*Captain.* 'Tis true, my lords, he did.\n","*Lear.* Did I not, fellow?\n","I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion\n","I would have made them skip. I am old now,\n","And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?\n ","Mine eyes are not o' th' best. I'll tell you straight.\n","*Earl of Kent.* If fortune brag of two she lov'd and hated,\n","One of them we behold.\n","*Lear.* This' a dull sight.

All's cheerless, dark, and deadly.\n","Your eldest daughters have fordone themselves,\n ","And desperately are dead.\n","*Lear.* Ay, so I think.\n","*Duke of Albany.* He knows not what he says; and vain is it\n","That we present us to him.\n","*Edgar.* Very bootless.\n ","*Captain.* Edmund is dead, my lord.\n","*Duke of Albany.* That's but a trifle here.\n","You lords and noble friends, know our intent.\n","What comfort to this great decay may come\n ","Shall be applied. For us, we will resign,\n","During the life of this old Majesty,\n","To him our absolute power; _[to Edgar and Kent]_ you to your\n","   rights;\n","With boot, and such addition as your honours\n ","Have more than merited.- All friends shall taste\n","The wages of their virtue, and all foes\n","The cup of their deservings.- O, see, see!\n","*Lear.* And my poor fool is hang'd!
