These Moors are changeable in\n ","their wills: fill thy purse with money:-the food\n","that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be\n","to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must\n","change for youth: when she is sated with his body,\n","she will find the error of her choice: she must\n ","have change, she must: therefore put money in thy\n","purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a\n","more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money\n","thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt\n","an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not\n ","too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou\n","shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of\n","drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek\n","thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than\n","to be drowned and go without her.\n ","*Roderigo.* Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on\n","the issue?\n","*Iago.* Thou art sure of me:-go, make money:-I have told\n","thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I\n","hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no\n ","less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge\n","against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost\n","thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many\n","events in the womb of time which will be delivered.\n","Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more\n ","of this to-morrow.
