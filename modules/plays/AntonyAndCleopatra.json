Charmian, is this well done?\n","*Charmian.* It is well done, and fitting for a princess\n","Descended of so many royal kings.\n","Ah, soldier!\n","*Dolabella.* How goes it here?\n","*Second Guard.* All dead.\n","*Dolabella.* Caesar, thy thoughts\n","Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming\n ","To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou\n","So sought'st to hinder.\n","*Dolabella.* O sir, you are too sure an augurer;\n ","That you did fear is done.\n","*Octavius.* Bravest at the last,\n","She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,\n","Took her own way.
