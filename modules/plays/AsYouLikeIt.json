For my part, he keeps me\n","rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at\n","home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my\n","birth that differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses are\n","bred better; for, besides that they are fair with their feeding,\n ","they are taught their manage, and to that end riders dearly\n","hir'd; but I, his brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for\n","the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him\n","as I. Besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me, the\n","something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from\n ","me. He lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a\n","brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my\n","education. This is it, Adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of\n","my father, which I think is within me, begins to mutiny against\n","this servitude.

She is at\n","the court, and no less beloved of her uncle than his own\n","daughter; and never two ladies loved as they do.\n","*Oliver.* Where will the old Duke live?\n","*Charles.* They say he is already in the Forest of Arden, and a many\n ","merry men with him; and there they live like the old Robin Hood\n","of England.

I am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger\n","brother, Orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against\n","me to try a fall. To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he\n","that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.\n","Your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, I would\n ","be loath to foil him, as I must, for my own honour, if he come\n","in; therefore, out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint\n","you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,\n","or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into, in that it is\n","thing of his own search and altogether against my will.\n ","*Oliver.* Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which thou shalt\n","find I will most kindly requite. I had myself notice of my\n","brother's purpose herein, and have by underhand means laboured to\n","dissuade him from it; but he is resolute. I'll tell thee,\n","Charles, it is the stubbornest young fellow of France; full of\n ","ambition, an envious emulator of every man's good parts, a secret\n","and villainous contriver against me his natural brother.\n","Therefore use thy discretion: I had as lief thou didst break his\n","neck as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if thou\n","dost him any slight disgrace, or if he do not mightily grace\n ","himself on thee, he will practise against thee by poison, entrap\n","thee by some treacherous device, and never leave thee till he\n","hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; for, I\n","assure thee, and almost with tears I speak it, there is not one\n","so young and so villainous this day living. I speak but brotherly\n ","of him; but should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must blush\n","and weep, and thou must look pale and wonder.\n","*Charles.* I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come\n","to-morrow I'll give him his payment. If ever he go alone again,\n","I'll never wrestle for prize more. And so, God keep your worship!  Exit\n ","*Oliver.* Farewell, good Charles. Now will I stir this gamester. I\n","hope I shall see an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,\n","hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle; never school'd and\n","yet learned; full of noble device; of all sorts enchantingly\n","beloved; and, indeed, so much in the heart of the world, and\n ","especially of my own people, who best know him, that I am\n","altogether misprised. But it shall not be so long; this wrestler\n","shall clear all. Nothing remains but that I kindle the boy\n","thither, which now I'll go about.

Yet I profess curing\n","it by counsel.\n ","*Orlando.* Did you ever cure any so?\n","*Rosalind.* Yes, one; and in this manner.

This to be true\n ","I do engage my life.\n","*Duke.* Welcome, young man.\n","Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:\n","To one, his lands withheld; and to the other,\n","A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.\n ","First, in this forest let us do those ends\n","That here were well begun and well begot;\n","And after, every of this happy number,\n","That have endur'd shrewd days and nights with us,\n","Shall share the good of our returned fortune,\n ","According to the measure of their states.\n","Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity,\n","And fall into our rustic revelry.\n","Play, music; and you brides and bridegrooms all,\n","With measure heap'd in joy, to th' measures fall.\n ","*Jaques (lord).* Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,\n","The Duke hath put on a religious life,\n","And thrown into neglect the pompous court.\n","*Jaques (son).* He hath.\n","*Jaques (lord).* To him will I. Out of these convertites\n ","There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.\n","_[To DUKE]_ You to your former honour I bequeath;\n","Your patience and your virtue well deserves it.\n","_[To ORLANDO]_ You to a love that your true faith doth merit;\n","_[To OLIVER]_ You to your land, and love, and great allies\n ","_[To SILVIUS]_ You to a long and well-deserved bed;\n","_[To TOUCHSTONE]_ And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage\n","Is but for two months victuall'd.- So to your pleasures;\n","I am for other than for dancing measures.\n","*Duke.* Stay, Jaques, stay.\n ","*Jaques (lord).* To see no pastime I. What you would have\n","I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave. Exit\n","*Duke.* Proceed, proceed. We will begin these rites,\n","As we do trust they'll end, in true delights. _[A dance]_ Exeunt EPILOGUE\n","*Rosalind.* It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue; but\n","it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue. If it\n","be true that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true that a good play\n","needs no epilogue. Yet to good wine they do use good bushes; and\n","good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues. What a\n ","case am I in then, that am neither a good epilogue, nor cannot\n","insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play! I am not\n","furnish'd like a beggar; therefore to beg will not become me. My\n","way is to conjure you; and I'll begin with the women. I charge\n","you, O women, for the love you bear to men, to like as much of\n ","this play as please you; and I charge you, O men, for the love\n","you bear to women- as I perceive by your simp'ring none of you\n","hates them- that between you and the women the play may please.\n","If I were a woman, I would kiss as many of you as had beards that\n","pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defied\n ","not; and, I am sure, as many as have good beards, or good faces,\n","or sweet breaths, will, for my kind offer, when I make curtsy,\n","bid me farewell.\n"]}]}
