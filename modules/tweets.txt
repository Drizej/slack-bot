Dec 15, 2016 9:28:54 AM The media tries so hard to make my move to the White House, as it pertains to my business, so complex - when actually it isn't!

Dec 13, 2016 8:44:06 AM The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments.
Dec 13, 2016 7:57:35 AM Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have just certified my wins in those states. I actually picked up additional votes!
Dec 13, 2016 7:43:38 AM I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State.
Dec 13, 2016 12:41:33 AM I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest. Busy times!

Dec 12, 2016 9:21:20 AM Unless you catch "hackers" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking. Why wasn't this brought up before election?
Dec 12, 2016 9:17:54 AM Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!

Nov 17, 2016 8:46:23 AM My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA
Nov 16, 2016 8:25:21 AM Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.
Nov 16, 2016 8:17:12 AM I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,
Nov 16, 2016 8:12:30 AM The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.
Nov 16, 2016 7:28:57 AM I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story.
Nov 15, 2016 10:55:34 PM Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
Nov 15, 2016 9:40:29 AM The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!
Nov 15, 2016 9:34:43 AM If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
Nov 13, 2016 2:46:36 PM The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!
Nov 13, 2016 12:33:26 PM I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!
Nov 13, 2016 12:03:21 PM The @nytimes states today that DJT believes "more countries should acquire nuclear weapons." How dishonest are they. I never said this!
Nov 13, 2016 11:28:52 AM Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!
Nov 13, 2016 11:23:28 AM Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice!
Nov 13, 2016 10:45:28 AM Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!
Nov 13, 2016 10:43:09 AM The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?
Nov 13, 2016 10:16:46 AM Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena"
Nov 12, 2016 11:05:33 AM This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win!
Nov 11, 2016 11:26:37 AM Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces. #ThankAVet https://t.co/wPk7QWpK8Z
Nov 11, 2016 9:33:35 AM Busy day planned in New York. Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government!
Nov 11, 2016 7:14:20 AM Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country. We will all come together and be proud!
Nov 10, 2016 10:19:44 PM Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!
Nov 10, 2016 10:10:46 PM A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!

Sep 10, 2016 9:14:10 PM The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!
Sep 10, 2016 7:37:06 PM Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
Sep 10, 2016 4:46:30 PM RT @BarackObama: RT if you agree: We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.
Sep 10, 2016 2:18:37 PM While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!
Sep 10, 2016 11:54:27 AM Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!

Sep 6, 2016 7:12:11 AM China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!
Sep 6, 2016 7:00:56 AM The truly great Phyllis Schlafly, who honored me with her strong endorsement for president, has passed away at 92. She was very special!

Sep 4, 2016 7:49:48 PM Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED. How can this be happening?

Sep 4, 2016 8:55:58 AM Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release. They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source
Sep 3, 2016 4:36:39 PM .@CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals.

Aug 14, 2016 9:34:25 PM Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
Aug 14, 2016 8:07:43 PM "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!
Aug 14, 2016 7:57:37 PM I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
Aug 14, 2016 1:06:20 PM It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
Aug 14, 2016 12:55:07 PM I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
Aug 14, 2016 12:50:51 PM Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
Aug 14, 2016 8:46:17 AM My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
Aug 14, 2016 8:37:37 AM If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%
Aug 14, 2016 8:31:23 AM The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said
Aug 14, 2016 8:24:48 AM The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!
Aug 13, 2016 4:08:01 PM "@zulu_out: You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks

Aug 13, 2016 4:02:38 PM We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY. How can she run for Pres.
Aug 13, 2016 3:39:23 PM "@willspeakout: Thank you for all that you are doing for us! You campaign endlessly and have spent millions.We love you! #TrumpTrain" Thanks
Aug 13, 2016 2:39:26 PM I am truly enjoying myself while running for president. The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th!
Aug 13, 2016 2:29:23 PM The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction. Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources. Very dishonest!

Aug 12, 2016 7:07:51 AM A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda. What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday!

Aug 1, 2016 6:54:27 PM During the GOP convention, CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence. They don’t want them heard. https://t.co/EHRiLkQDWD
Aug 1, 2016 6:52:39 PM When will CNN do a segment on Hillary’s plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost?
Aug 1, 2016 6:52:00 PM Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.
Aug 1, 2016 6:46:28 PM Hillary, whose decisions have led to the deaths of many, accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS. Silence at CNN. https://t.co/gJYSSXtpaz

Aug 1, 2016 2:47:54 PM People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!
Aug 1, 2016 2:46:58 PM The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life.
Aug 1, 2016 2:45:22 PM Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary?
Aug 1, 2016 2:44:04 PM When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department?
Aug 1, 2016 2:43:25 PM CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs.
Aug 1, 2016 2:42:50 PM CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.

Aug 1, 2016 9:03:02 AM So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push. That's what I said!
Aug 1, 2016 8:50:32 AM When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!
Aug 1, 2016 7:27:43 AM This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
Aug 1, 2016 7:10:51 AM Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!
Jul 31, 2016 8:57:15 PM Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us. The failing @nytimes is a joke. @CNN is laughable!
Jul 31, 2016 4:31:06 PM "@RealJamesWoods: Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance. #VoterFraud and #MSM her only hope."
Jul 31, 2016 4:09:00 PM The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention. I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H?
Jul 31, 2016 9:32:55 AM I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention. Am I not allowed to respond? Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!
Jul 31, 2016 8:57:21 AM Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it!

Jul 30, 2016 6:18:58 PM Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!
Jul 30, 2016 6:12:36 PM The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!
Jul 30, 2016 6:04:14 PM Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP
Jul 30, 2016 5:55:48 PM #CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below. https://t.co/y9WJoUaaql
Jul 30, 2016 5:51:25 PM Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
Jul 30, 2016 4:01:32 PM I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!
Jul 30, 2016 3:55:26 PM Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings
Jul 30, 2016 2:34:54 PM #CrookedHillary https://t.co/xyoPFJmByp
Jul 30, 2016 2:07:07 PM Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!
Jul 30, 2016 2:06:17 PM Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.

Jul 30, 2016 8:57:48 AM We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.
Jul 30, 2016 8:54:44 AM Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.

Jul 29, 2016 10:14:25 AM Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!
Jul 29, 2016 10:06:38 AM If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town! #NeverHillary

Jul 29, 2016 9:44:54 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!

Jul 29, 2016 8:51:13 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!
Jul 29, 2016 8:40:10 AM The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
Jul 28, 2016 11:59:04 PM No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
Jul 28, 2016 11:57:06 PM Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
Jul 28, 2016 11:54:22 PM Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
Jul 28, 2016 11:52:46 PM Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
Jul 28, 2016 11:50:59 PM Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
Jul 28, 2016 11:47:56 PM Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

Jul 27, 2016 10:39:07 PM Shooting deaths of police officers up 78% this year. We must restore law and order and protect our great law enforcement officers!

Jul 27, 2016 9:01:03 AM Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
Jul 27, 2016 8:57:20 AM Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!
Jul 27, 2016 6:08:35 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
Jul 27, 2016 6:01:39 AM Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
Jul 27, 2016 5:50:55 AM The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
Jul 27, 2016 5:43:16 AM Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!
Jul 27, 2016 5:33:52 AM As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.
Jul 26, 2016 11:01:04 PM Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP. https://t.co/eoNTWK6I8y
Jul 26, 2016 10:11:47 PM Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena. Did Bernie go home and go to sleep?
Jul 26, 2016 10:08:50 PM I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention!
Jul 26, 2016 10:02:24 PM No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible. Highly overrated!
Jul 26, 2016 9:51:45 PM You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing). Please get your facts straight - thanks. @megynkelly

Jul 26, 2016 6:47:28 PM In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump. Crazy!
Jul 26, 2016 3:48:08 PM Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
Jul 26, 2016 3:27:58 PM Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!
Jul 26, 2016 3:27:43 PM The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!

Jul 26, 2016 8:42:33 AM Pocahontas bombed last night! Sad to watch.
Jul 26, 2016 8:38:27 AM Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
Jul 26, 2016 8:34:19 AM Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference
Jul 25, 2016 11:19:38 PM Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
Jul 25, 2016 11:12:57 PM Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
Jul 25, 2016 11:04:56 PM Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
Jul 25, 2016 10:14:29 PM If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
Jul 25, 2016 5:57:14 PM I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
Jul 25, 2016 5:45:54 PM Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
Jul 25, 2016 5:33:49 PM While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
Jul 25, 2016 5:32:59 PM Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

Jul 25, 2016 10:05:27 AM Great POLL numbers are coming out all over. People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse. #MAGA
Jul 25, 2016 10:01:25 AM The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
Jul 25, 2016 9:47:45 AM Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
Jul 25, 2016 9:42:55 AM Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
Jul 25, 2016 9:19:18 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.
Jul 25, 2016 8:27:35 AM If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
Jul 25, 2016 8:26:56 AM Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam [Twitter for iPad]
Jul 25, 2016 8:02:01 AM Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
Jul 25, 2016 7:57:17 AM How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!
Jul 25, 2016 7:31:22 AM The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me
Jul 24, 2016 7:59:10 PM Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!
Jul 24, 2016 7:47:08 PM The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!
Jul 24, 2016 6:33:42 PM The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
Jul 24, 2016 6:16:59 PM The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
Jul 24, 2016 6:07:49 PM Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
Jul 24, 2016 6:02:42 PM Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
Jul 24, 2016 5:53:29 PM If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild
Jul 24, 2016 4:45:31 PM The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
Jul 24, 2016 4:30:06 PM I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
Jul 24, 2016 4:20:57 PM Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)
Jul 24, 2016 9:30:59 AM Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
Jul 24, 2016 9:27:56 AM There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
Jul 24, 2016 8:30:15 AM An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
Jul 24, 2016 8:15:51 AM Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
Jul 24, 2016 7:56:43 AM Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
Jul 24, 2016 7:25:06 AM Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
Jul 24, 2016 7:16:15 AM The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

Jul 23, 2016 6:05:55 PM Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night. From the heart!
Jul 23, 2016 5:20:58 PM The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!
Jul 23, 2016 4:43:33 PM Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
Jul 23, 2016 12:06:15 PM I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
Jul 23, 2016 11:36:41 AM Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
Jul 23, 2016 11:01:48 AM Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
Jul 23, 2016 10:51:32 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
Jul 23, 2016 6:55:20 AM Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
Jul 23, 2016 6:42:10 AM Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
Jul 23, 2016 6:35:37 AM Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
Jul 23, 2016 6:31:18 AM The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
Jul 22, 2016 11:56:38 PM "@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain"
Jul 22, 2016 11:49:04 PM I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
Jul 22, 2016 11:23:15 PM Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
Jul 22, 2016 7:03:19 PM Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.
Jul 22, 2016 10:06:01 AM One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions. Great unity! Big T.V. ratings! @KarlRove

Jul 20, 2016 1:02:19 PM STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH https://t.co/uzBOm21Pug
Jul 20, 2016 11:36:06 AM The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
Jul 20, 2016 11:31:15 AM Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
Jul 20, 2016 8:51:58 AM In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!
Jul 20, 2016 8:47:56 AM Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.
Jul 20, 2016 6:18:17 AM Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night. I am very proud of you!

Jul 17, 2016 9:09:02 AM The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close. That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like
Jul 17, 2016 9:04:10 AM .@FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative. Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary! I don't watch.
Jul 17, 2016 8:24:04 AM If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today. Pick her H
Jul 17, 2016 8:14:46 AM I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!
Jul 17, 2016 8:06:18 AM It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!
Jul 17, 2016 7:55:21 AM As the days and weeks go by, we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!
Jul 17, 2016 12:19:05 AM We are going to have a great time in Cleveland. Will lead to special results for our country. We will Make America Great Again!
Jul 17, 2016 12:15:49 AM Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud. Without the con it's over

Jul 16, 2016 9:23:17 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests. She will sell our country down the tubes!
Jul 16, 2016 9:19:11 AM Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money!
Jul 16, 2016 9:13:56 AM Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy. Look what's happening!
Jul 16, 2016 9:08:43 AM Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done
Jul 16, 2016 8:29:43 AM Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana). My first choice from start!

Jul 15, 2016 10:41:20 AM Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable. Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary!
Jul 15, 2016 10:31:18 AM #NeverTrump is never more. They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Jul 14, 2016 8:39:27 PM My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice, France. We are with you in every way!
Jul 14, 2016 7:09:57 PM In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement.
Jul 14, 2016 6:40:31 PM Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France. Many dead and injured. When will we learn? It is only getting worse.
Jul 14, 2016 1:23:58 PM I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! Crooked Hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with NAFTA.

Jul 13, 2016 6:28:44 PM If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!
Jul 13, 2016 6:27:45 PM Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?
Jul 13, 2016 6:26:20 PM Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
Jul 13, 2016 6:23:40 PM On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
Jul 13, 2016 6:22:20 PM Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
Jul 13, 2016 6:19:48 PM Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!
Jul 13, 2016 6:11:04 PM Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common. https://t.co/teoVCYXKOR
Jul 13, 2016 6:06:30 PM Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!
Jul 13, 2016 6:05:22 PM The Republican platform is most pro-Israel of all time!
Jul 13, 2016 5:56:42 PM New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!

Jul 12, 2016 1:03:44 PM Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Jul 12, 2016 1:01:51 PM Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
Jul 12, 2016 12:45:45 PM #CrookedHillary is not qualified! https://t.co/6qi7KTW43O
Jul 12, 2016 9:39:56 AM I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!
Jul 12, 2016 9:36:47 AM Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!
Jul 12, 2016 8:57:18 AM This election is a choice between law, order & safety - or chaos, crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou
Jul 12, 2016 8:55:29 AM For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need.

Jul 10, 2016 2:58:10 PM I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies. Happily, few people are watching - dead network!
Jul 10, 2016 2:42:32 PM The media is so dishonest. If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish.They think the public is stupid!
Jul 10, 2016 2:27:58 PM President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!
Jul 10, 2016 8:02:02 AM Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton. We are a divided nation!

Jul 8, 2016 5:31:01 PM Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @CNN?
Jul 8, 2016 10:32:15 AM Due to the horrific events taking place in our country, I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami.

Jul 6, 2016 11:32:35 AM Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow. Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live.
Jul 6, 2016 10:06:38 AM I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton. Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics
Jul 6, 2016 10:01:09 AM Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again.He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N.C.
Jul 6, 2016 9:24:50 AM Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A.C. Others to follow. Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City.
Jul 6, 2016 9:12:43 AM Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City
Jul 6, 2016 9:08:44 AM I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
Jul 6, 2016 8:31:27 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!
Jul 6, 2016 8:11:03 AM The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...https://t.co/KO64IAMDgj https://t.co/8CBSfNpl2l
Jul 6, 2016 7:21:34 AM Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
Jul 6, 2016 7:12:45 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!
Jul 6, 2016 12:36:31 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
Jul 6, 2016 12:30:04 AM I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out!
Jul 6, 2016 12:23:03 AM Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win
Jul 5, 2016 10:21:20 PM I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm. Enjoy!

Jul 5, 2016 11:39:06 AM FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem
Jul 5, 2016 11:37:23 AM The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual, bad judgment.
Jul 5, 2016 8:05:46 AM It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!
Jul 5, 2016 7:14:58 AM Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
Jul 4, 2016 6:59:46 PM On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy!
Jul 4, 2016 6:30:15 PM Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
Jul 4, 2016 11:34:15 AM With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
Jul 4, 2016 11:26:56 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?
Jul 4, 2016 10:25:04 AM The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
Jul 4, 2016 10:19:13 AM I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!
Jul 4, 2016 10:11:09 AM Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed, great people!
Jul 4, 2016 9:56:34 AM Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!
Jul 4, 2016 9:42:16 AM Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!
Jul 4, 2016 9:32:35 AM Happy 4th of July! #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst https://t.co/Ndb3AQrLtY https://t.co/YhHyQjwJW6
Jul 4, 2016 8:00:11 AM Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
Jul 4, 2016 7:54:40 AM The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
Jul 4, 2016 7:35:16 AM In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
Jul 3, 2016 5:46:58 PM I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
Jul 3, 2016 5:43:25 PM The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures."
Jul 3, 2016 5:38:20 PM Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
Jul 3, 2016 5:00:39 PM "THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"
Jul 3, 2016 4:47:51 PM On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
Jul 3, 2016 4:20:20 PM Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!
Jul 3, 2016 4:16:23 PM Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
Jul 3, 2016 1:40:49 PM Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!
Jul 2, 2016 5:13:02 PM It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
Jul 2, 2016 4:39:39 PM It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

Jul 1, 2016 8:12:48 AM Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
Jul 1, 2016 8:12:06 AM Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
Jul 1, 2016 8:11:41 AM As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!

Jun 30, 2016 3:30:54 PM The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Jun 30, 2016 3:30:20 PM I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
Jun 30, 2016 3:29:48 PM The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!
Jun 30, 2016 3:28:27 PM One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America. https://t.co/mO9QrmYXRD

Jun 12, 2016 4:47:36 PM What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning. Our leadership is weak and ineffective. I called it and asked for the ban. Must be tough
Jun 12, 2016 3:02:42 PM "@WandaWalls20: @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe. We cannot have Hillary as president. We will be in so much trouble.
Jun 12, 2016 2:52:13 PM Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar!" as he slaughtered clubgoers. 2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade.
Jun 12, 2016 1:58:00 PM Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
Jun 12, 2016 12:43:17 PM Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance. We must be smart!
Jun 12, 2016 11:45:19 AM Horrific incident in FL. Praying for all the victims & their families. When will this stop? When will we get tough, smart & vigilant?
Jun 12, 2016 9:39:47 AM Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story. I would NEVER mock disabled. Shame!

Jun 6, 2016 9:15:19 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!

May 30, 2016 7:00:47 AM In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary!
May 30, 2016 6:41:49 AM Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W.H.
May 29, 2016 7:02:01 PM If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court!
May 29, 2016 6:58:27 PM The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November. Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate!
May 29, 2016 6:53:16 PM Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party. Be tough, R's!
May 29, 2016 5:43:15 PM Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.
May 29, 2016 12:45:44 PM Heading to D.C. to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER. Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY. Great spirit!
May 29, 2016 7:04:47 AM Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country! We love them.
May 28, 2016 5:34:55 PM Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
May 28, 2016 5:33:58 PM Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
May 28, 2016 4:28:48 PM I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!
May 28, 2016 4:28:40 PM The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!
May 28, 2016 4:28:22 PM The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people. I have 73, Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her.
May 28, 2016 10:47:16 AM I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go! Thank you.
May 28, 2016 9:47:10 AM The U.S. has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders. How nice, but what do we get? NOT ENOUGH

May 25, 2016 9:14:58 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie. I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates. Hillary doesn't have it
May 25, 2016 8:31:56 AM Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U.S. Senate than practically any other senator. All talk, no action!
May 25, 2016 8:17:40 AM @elizabethforma Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes known as Pocahontas, bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing. Total hypocrite!

May 24, 2016 7:42:35 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs. Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement!
May 24, 2016 6:41:44 AM I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F.E.C. Even the dishonest media thinks great!
May 23, 2016 10:50:48 PM Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media.
May 23, 2016 10:46:08 PM Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups.
May 23, 2016 10:38:48 PM While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS. Nice!

May 22, 2016 3:37:05 PM How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women?

May 20, 2016 6:08:49 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential? I don't think so! Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back. ISIS LAUGHS!

May 17, 2016 7:58:10 AM Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U.S. political history
May 17, 2016 7:52:00 AM Oregon is voting today. Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
May 17, 2016 7:46:22 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women. Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts! My hit was on China
May 17, 2016 7:37:03 AM The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line. "You can tell them to go BLANK themselves" - was about China, NOT WOMEN!
May 17, 2016 7:29:09 AM Wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton. She said they had to do with a wedding reception. Liar! How can she run?

May 16, 2016 11:46:35 PM I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N.Y. construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty. So much for a nice thank you!

May 16, 2016 6:15:52 PM The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond.
May 16, 2016 6:14:19 PM Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6. That’s because there were so many positive statements.
May 16, 2016 6:13:20 PM No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious & libelous story they did on me.
May 16, 2016 6:12:53 PM The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women.

May 16, 2016 9:12:38 AM Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied
May 16, 2016 9:09:26 AM The @nytimes is so dishonest. Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie!
May 16, 2016 7:00:58 AM That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is!
May 16, 2016 6:00:52 AM Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems. The system is rigged against him. He should run as an independent! Run Bernie, run.

May 2, 2016 10:06:30 AM Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags. I want America First - so do voters!
May 2, 2016 7:21:02 AM Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs, and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA.
May 2, 2016 7:12:40 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation." Actually, she has done poorly with such men!
May 2, 2016 6:42:59 AM I will be interviewed on @CNN @NewDay at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!

May 1, 2016 11:47:29 AM I watched Sen. Graham @FaceTheNation. Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy, and in the end he had no support?

Apr 29, 2016 9:46:49 AM Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers!
Apr 29, 2016 7:22:04 AM Wow, the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up. What a dumb deal - dead on arrival!

Apr 25, 2016 12:15:58 PM Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
Apr 25, 2016 7:59:06 AM Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
Apr 25, 2016 7:54:21 AM Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
Apr 24, 2016 11:49:17 PM Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
Apr 24, 2016 11:39:58 PM Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
Apr 24, 2016 9:27:12 PM I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!

Apr 21, 2016 5:47:21 PM Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
Apr 21, 2016 6:22:03 AM Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

Apr 17, 2016 9:38:31 AM Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
Apr 17, 2016 9:34:25 AM Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him.

Mar 29, 2016 12:44:36 PM Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape?
Mar 29, 2016 12:41:33 PM Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter. Look at tapes-nothing there!
Mar 29, 2016 10:45:37 AM How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz?
Mar 29, 2016 10:16:19 AM I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC.
Mar 29, 2016 9:34:36 AM Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows. Really one-sided and unfair reporting. Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight!
Mar 28, 2016 9:07:23 PM We need to secure our borders ASAP. No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN!
Mar 28, 2016 9:04:06 PM Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates. You should focus on jobs & illegal imm!
Mar 28, 2016 8:57:35 PM Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big, so now he wants to debate again. But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debates

Mar 18, 2016 8:40:10 PM Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!
Mar 18, 2016 5:55:11 PM Everybody should boycott the @megynkelly show. Never worth watching. Always a hit on Trump! She is sick, & the most overrated person on tv.

Mar 18, 2016 4:37:31 PM Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!
Mar 18, 2016 4:21:17 PM Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2
Mar 18, 2016 4:18:14 PM Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who "choked" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me!
Mar 18, 2016 4:07:50 PM Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary
Mar 18, 2016 4:05:51 PM Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1,000,000.00 from me. Remember, I said- NO! https://t.co/suIfdiMg0Q
Mar 18, 2016 3:57:35 PM Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful!
Mar 18, 2016 3:44:17 PM With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this?
Mar 18, 2016 3:08:05 PM .@EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedState and now he is the one leading opposition against me.
Mar 18, 2016 3:03:48 PM Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz – and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians!
Mar 18, 2016 12:42:29 PM Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0!

Mar 17, 2016 9:22:07 AM Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc., all 11 of them!
Mar 17, 2016 9:11:31 AM .@WSJ is bad at math. The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me!
Mar 17, 2016 9:08:55 AM .@WSJ Editorial says "Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551.Trump's is 7,533,692"-a knock. But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16.Apologize
Mar 17, 2016 8:28:17 AM The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem!
Mar 17, 2016 8:19:55 AM Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me.Tough!
Mar 17, 2016 6:40:53 AM Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question? I beat Cruz debating
Mar 17, 2016 6:17:00 AM Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night. Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse. Ted can't win!
Mar 17, 2016 6:09:00 AM Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump. Sad!

Mar 16, 2016 1:13:17 PM In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide.The establishment should save their $$!
Mar 16, 2016 1:04:49 PM Yesterday was amazing—5 victories. Lyin’ Ted Cruz had zero. Things are going very well!

Mar 15, 2016 7:06:59 PM Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida. Numbers out soon!
Mar 15, 2016 3:11:12 PM A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.
Mar 15, 2016 12:16:16 PM I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.
Mar 15, 2016 12:03:57 PM In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
Mar 15, 2016 11:03:34 AM Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
Mar 15, 2016 10:53:41 AM Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.

Mar 15, 2016 7:31:46 AM Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc.).
Mar 15, 2016 6:39:06 AM Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
Mar 15, 2016 6:25:53 AM I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL
Mar 15, 2016 12:21:20 AM Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Mar 15, 2016 12:10:00 AM Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!

Feb 28, 2016 8:20:19 AM While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins, Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles.GROWING PARTY
Feb 28, 2016 8:10:36 AM The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to "hit" Trump.I signed the pledge-careful
Feb 28, 2016 7:28:47 AM While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil), word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio, the lightweight from Florida

Feb 27, 2016 5:20:48 PM Just watched lightweight Marco Rubio lying to a small crowd about my past record. He is not as smart as Cruz, and may be an even bigger liar
Feb 27, 2016 1:11:35 PM .#RogerStone was just banned by @CNN - their loss! Tough, loyal guy.
Feb 27, 2016 12:08:40 PM I started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the World. Amazing!
Feb 27, 2016 12:04:35 PM I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says. He didn't - total fabrication!
Feb 27, 2016 11:49:52 AM Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people!
Feb 27, 2016 11:25:07 AM I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz!
Feb 27, 2016 11:20:33 AM Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit. After the audit, no problem!
Feb 27, 2016 11:12:47 AM I unfairly get audited by the I.R.S. almost every single year. I have rich friends who never get audited. I wonder why?

Feb 26, 2016 4:52:02 PM They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high & dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!
Feb 26, 2016 12:38:36 PM Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.
Feb 26, 2016 12:17:29 PM Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night. Great honor!
Feb 26, 2016 12:16:14 PM Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!
Feb 26, 2016 12:15:06 PM Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement. They failed!
Feb 26, 2016 12:07:56 PM Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A.M. Big crowd - get there early! Big announcement to be made!
Feb 26, 2016 10:49:40 AM Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit!
Feb 26, 2016 10:02:29 AM Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday. Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done. Loser!
Feb 26, 2016 9:56:30 AM I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth, Texas. Really big crowd expected. Will be talking about the debate last night-plus, plus!

Feb 25, 2016 12:22:44 PM Just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone’s net worth. I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC. They are great!
Feb 25, 2016 12:05:01 PM Why doesn’t @MittRomney just endorse @marcorubio already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway. Too late now!
Feb 25, 2016 8:34:11 AM Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns. Dope!

Feb 22, 2016 5:11:17 PM Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa. Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen! Sad.
Feb 22, 2016 5:06:25 PM Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks. He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy?
Feb 22, 2016 4:55:16 PM Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks. No wonder he has lost Evangelical support!
Feb 22, 2016 4:50:18 PM Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact. Take ad down Ted. Biggest liar in politics!
Feb 22, 2016 4:44:02 PM Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director. More dirty tricks!
Feb 22, 2016 4:37:55 PM It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done.

Feb 12, 2016 5:54:11 PM Millions of $'s of false ads, paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz and sleepy @JebBush, are now running in S.C.

Feb 12, 2016 5:37:19 PM "@by @tedcruz good I want to see the court decide what I was always told "natural born" means - born on American soil"

Feb 12, 2016 4:30:07 PM Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time, he is out!
Feb 12, 2016 3:45:53 PM If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.
Feb 12, 2016 2:59:38 PM Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad!
Feb 12, 2016 2:22:20 PM After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads.
Feb 12, 2016 2:22:06 PM Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution, which naturally, they did not get.

Feb 12, 2016 8:03:41 AM How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest?
Feb 12, 2016 12:20:33 AM Lying Cruz put out a statement, “Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3?

Feb 11, 2016 3:45:59 PM Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!
Feb 11, 2016 12:51:04 PM He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Feb 11, 2016 12:14:10 PM Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT
Feb 11, 2016 11:40:04 AM .@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize!
Feb 11, 2016 11:11:56 AM Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!
Feb 11, 2016 10:13:09 AM There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!
Feb 10, 2016 10:51:40 PM I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!

Feb 10, 2016 9:00:20 AM Like the worthless @NYDailyNews, looks like @politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money, no cred!

Feb 9, 2016 8:16:37 AM No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!
Feb 9, 2016 8:08:19 AM I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!
Feb 9, 2016 8:00:30 AM Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!

Feb 8, 2016 12:33:15 PM Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.

Feb 3, 2016 4:22:46 PM Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace!
Feb 3, 2016 3:25:08 PM The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!

Feb 3, 2016 10:28:59 AM Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
Feb 3, 2016 10:21:03 AM And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!
Feb 3, 2016 10:10:53 AM The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
Feb 3, 2016 10:07:25 AM Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
Feb 3, 2016 9:56:48 AM During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
Feb 3, 2016 9:47:33 AM Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

Feb 2, 2016 12:39:05 PM I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one. I will keep doing, but not worth it!
Feb 2, 2016 12:34:02 PM I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire. Big crowd
Feb 2, 2016 12:29:05 PM The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly. Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
Feb 2, 2016 12:14:24 PM Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio. Came in a strong second. Great honor
Feb 2, 2016 12:03:21 PM My experience in Iowa was a great one. I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place. Nice

Jan 31, 2016 10:40:25 AM If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000.
Jan 31, 2016 10:32:03 AM By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS.
Jan 31, 2016 10:22:35 AM Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies!
Jan 31, 2016 9:16:37 AM Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam!
Jan 31, 2016 9:06:25 AM Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!
Jan 31, 2016 8:49:34 AM I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!

Jan 31, 2016 8:31:03 AM .@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!
Jan 31, 2016 8:22:48 AM The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!

Jan 29, 2016 9:25:17 PM Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator is endorsing Canada Ted!
Jan 29, 2016 9:15:43 PM .@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected? @greta
Jan 29, 2016 9:10:56 PM The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.

Jan 22, 2016 10:08:41 PM Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.
Jan 22, 2016 10:04:23 PM Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
Jan 22, 2016 9:34:26 PM Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!
Jan 22, 2016 9:33:17 PM The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!

Jan 16, 2016 3:39:31 PM Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? https://t.co/rYGX9vazku
Jan 16, 2016 3:32:40 PM Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite
Jan 16, 2016 2:31:39 PM Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you! https://t.co/m98wooUwsG https://t.co/izBMhEZolh
Jan 16, 2016 2:26:54 PM Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
Jan 16, 2016 2:23:26 PM When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
Jan 16, 2016 2:22:40 PM Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
Jan 16, 2016 2:21:03 PM If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
Jan 16, 2016 12:11:28 PM Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes. https://t.co/hxdfy0mjVw
Jan 16, 2016 9:42:54 AM Great new numbers. Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/Z1lQdxQvRL https://t.co/GFYNUWWCYn
Jan 16, 2016 9:31:10 AM Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
Jan 16, 2016 8:23:00 AM Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?
Jan 16, 2016 8:17:32 AM Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
Jan 16, 2016 8:12:45 AM The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
Jan 16, 2016 7:52:46 AM Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
Jan 16, 2016 7:49:02 AM Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
Jan 16, 2016 7:40:13 AM Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so

Jan 13, 2016 12:32:24 AM The State Of The Union speech was one of the most boring, rambling and non-substantive I have heard in a long time. New leadership fast!

Jan 10, 2016 7:23:07 PM Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog. For starters, try getting a new publisher!
Jan 10, 2016 5:06:48 PM UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
Jan 10, 2016 5:06:26 PM This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
Jan 10, 2016 5:06:07 PM If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win.

Jan 2, 2016 4:00:17 PM Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president. Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better!
Jan 2, 2016 9:23:00 AM Hillary Clinton said that it is O.K. to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O.K. to do so in the U.S. We must be vigilant!
Jan 2, 2016 8:17:12 AM .@JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls. Has no chance!

Dec 25, 2015 4:11:18 PM Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!
Dec 25, 2015 3:38:17 PM .@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!
Dec 24, 2015 10:55:58 PM Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!
Dec 24, 2015 10:22:42 PM .@danielhalper Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!
Dec 24, 2015 9:56:08 PM .@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!
Dec 24, 2015 9:50:38 PM "@YesMrGilbert: @NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story" True, a total distortion of the facts!
Dec 24, 2015 7:28:54 PM I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Dec 24, 2015 7:04:08 PM .@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!
Dec 24, 2015 6:56:55 PM Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!
Dec 24, 2015 6:42:10 PM Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!
Dec 24, 2015 6:35:38 PM Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly
Dec 24, 2015 6:31:41 PM Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!
Dec 24, 2015 6:20:24 PM Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!
Dec 24, 2015 6:14:10 PM In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!
Dec 24, 2015 4:10:14 PM Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!

Dec 23, 2015 11:22:59 PM Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity

Dec 23, 2015 7:17:09 PM Hillary, when you complain about "a penchant for sexism," who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL!
Dec 23, 2015 1:20:55 PM It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media. New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead
Dec 23, 2015 11:55:23 AM Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump
Dec 23, 2015 11:49:01 AM .@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!
Dec 23, 2015 10:55:24 AM The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad

Dec 23, 2015 1:48:08 AM It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!
Dec 22, 2015 11:37:51 PM When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!

Dec 22, 2015 8:52:12 PM For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged," bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM
Dec 22, 2015 8:48:24 PM NPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #Hypocrisy
Dec 22, 2015 8:47:59 PM Once again, #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.
Dec 22, 2015 6:50:23 PM Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!
Dec 22, 2015 6:39:11 PM Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased!

Dec 22, 2015 5:22:50 PM Will @JebBush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate?
Dec 22, 2015 5:20:33 PM .@JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy. Will never work!

Dec 21, 2015 8:34:40 AM Hillary said with respect to ISIS, "we are finally where we need to be." Do we want 4 more years of incompetent leadership? MAGA!
Dec 21, 2015 7:51:04 AM I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video.
Dec 21, 2015 7:47:58 AM Hillary said at debate ISIS is "going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst." She made up story-want apology!

Dec 15, 2015 1:23:03 PM I won every debate so far according to all debate polls including @DRUDGE_REPORT, @TIME @Slate and more. Too bad dopey @megynkelly lies!

Dec 15, 2015 11:40:47 AM I wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. No matter how well I do - bad!
Dec 15, 2015 11:34:25 AM .@megynkelly is very bad at math. She was totally unable to figure out the difference between me and Cruz in the new Monmouth Poll 41to14.
Dec 15, 2015 11:30:25 AM .@megynkelly, the most overrated anchor at @FoxNews, worked hard to explain away the new Monmouth poll 41 to 14 or 27 pt lead. She said 15!
Dec 15, 2015 10:54:17 AM Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead. They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place).Dishonest press
Dec 15, 2015 10:47:56 AM Isn't it amazing that @CNN paid a fortune for an Iowa Poll, which shows me in first place over Cruz by 13%, 33% to 20% - then doesn't use it
Dec 15, 2015 10:29:02 AM Wow, I just had two very good Iowa polls and a phenomenal just out National Poll from @ABC @washingtonpost - 38%. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Nov 19, 2015 9:55:47 PM John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed, bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!
Nov 19, 2015 9:47:31 PM Once John Kasich announced he was running for president, and opened his mouth, people realized he was a complete & total dud!
Nov 19, 2015 9:06:59 PM John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare, and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!
Nov 19, 2015 9:06:49 PM Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else - he’s almost last.
Nov 19, 2015 9:06:28 PM I loved beating John Kasich in the debates, but it was easy—he came in dead last!
Nov 19, 2015 9:06:15 PM Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!
Nov 19, 2015 9:06:04 PM Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
Nov 19, 2015 9:05:54 PM I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money.
Nov 19, 2015 9:05:35 PM John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!
Nov 19, 2015 9:05:16 PM John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.
Nov 19, 2015 9:04:55 PM Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.

Nov 1, 2015 10:03:53 AM If Jeb Bush were more competent he could not have lost the skirmish with Marco in the debate. BAD facts for Marco if properly delivered!
Nov 1, 2015 9:58:31 AM Marco Rubio will not win. Weak on illegal immigration, strong on amnesty and has the appearance to killers of the world as a "lightweight".
Nov 1, 2015 9:52:09 AM I told you in speeches months ago that Jeb and Marco do not like each other. Marco is too ambitious and very disloyal to Jeb as his mentor!
Nov 1, 2015 9:48:26 AM Jeb's new slogan - "Jeb can fix it". I never thought of Jeb as a crook! Stupid message, the word "fix" is not a good one to use in politics!

Oct 15, 2015 2:44:47 PM .@CNBC is pushing the @GOP around by asking for extra time (and no criteria) in order to sell more commercials.
Oct 15, 2015 2:44:04 PM The @GOP should not agree to the ridiculous debate terms that @CNBC is asking unless there is a major benefit to the party.
Oct 15, 2015 2:33:07 PM .@KevinHart4real joined @woodmank104 @katek104 @K1047 & was asked about his thoughts on @realDonaldTrump #Trump2016 Thanks Kevin--so nice!

Aug 10, 2015 9:18:23 PM .@ericbolling you can do much better than you did tonight on @oreillyfactor. Better luck tomorrow!
Aug 10, 2015 9:03:56 PM Why is @RandPaul allowed to take advantage of the people of Kentucky by running for Senator and Pres. Why should Kentucky be back up plan?
Aug 10, 2015 8:58:57 PM We must stop the crime and killing machine that is illegal immigration. Rampant problems will only get worse. Take back our country!

Feb 24, 2015 11:33:34 AM Put the glamour, beauty & mystery back in the Oscars and the ratings will zoom. Also, & most importantly, the Oscars need credibility.

Feb 24, 2015 11:09:00 AM The @HuffingtonPost is a total joke & laughing stock of journalism, as is gross Arianna Huffington. They don’t report the facts!

Jan 30, 2015 3:08:26 PM Now that Mitt is gone, all we have to do is get Bush to drop out and Trump to run—and we will win!
Jan 30, 2015 3:07:17 PM When I broadly proclaimed Mitt “choked” – and would do it again—everybody said yeah, he’s right.
Jan 30, 2015 3:06:01 PM I will take full credit for Mitt Romney dropping out of the race—looks like he won’t be endorsing Trump any time soon.

Nov 25, 2014 4:25:13 AM Our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places
Nov 25, 2014 4:15:23 AM Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!
Nov 25, 2014 4:07:45 AM As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!
Nov 25, 2014 3:57:16 AM Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot
Nov 25, 2014 3:45:56 AM If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now!
