__Nov 19, 2016 9:39:34 AM__ The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!
__Nov 19, 2016 9:34:38 AM__ I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.
__Nov 18, 2016 6:35:27 PM__ Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

__Nov 17, 2016 10:15:28 PM__ I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!
__Nov 17, 2016 10:01:52 PM__ Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico
__Nov 17, 2016 8:46:23 AM__ My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA
__Nov 16, 2016 8:25:21 AM__ Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.
__Nov 16, 2016 8:17:12 AM__ I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,
__Nov 16, 2016 8:12:30 AM__ The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.
__Nov 16, 2016 7:28:57 AM__ I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story.
__Nov 15, 2016 10:55:34 PM__ Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
__Nov 15, 2016 9:40:29 AM__ The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!
__Nov 15, 2016 9:34:43 AM__ If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
__Nov 13, 2016 2:46:36 PM__ The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!
__Nov 13, 2016 12:33:26 PM__ I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!
__Nov 13, 2016 12:03:21 PM__ The @nytimes states today that DJT believes "more countries should acquire nuclear weapons." How dishonest are they. I never said this!
__Nov 13, 2016 11:28:52 AM__ Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!
__Nov 13, 2016 11:23:28 AM__ Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice!
__Nov 13, 2016 10:45:28 AM__ Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!
__Nov 13, 2016 10:43:09 AM__ The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?
__Nov 13, 2016 10:16:46 AM__ Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena"
__Nov 12, 2016 11:05:33 AM__ This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win!

__Nov 10, 2016 10:19:44 PM__ Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!
__Nov 10, 2016 10:10:46 PM__ A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!

__Sep 10, 2016 9:14:10 PM__ The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!
__Sep 10, 2016 7:37:06 PM__ Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
__Sep 10, 2016 4:46:30 PM__ RT @BarackObama: RT if you agree: We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.
__Sep 10, 2016 2:18:37 PM__ While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!
__Sep 10, 2016 11:54:27 AM__ Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!
__Sep 10, 2016 8:47:18 AM__ Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!

__Sep 9, 2016 10:37:53 AM__ .@CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.
__Sep 9, 2016 12:10:49 AM__ The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!

__Sep 8, 2016 2:16:25 PM__ Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto.
__Sep 8, 2016 12:25:36 PM__ Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
__Sep 8, 2016 11:17:47 AM__ Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!

__Sep 4, 2016 6:05:29 PM__ The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.

__Aug 25, 2016 5:25:15 PM__ HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail, they are left w/this one tired argument! https://t.co/FNbCMmwLTn
__Aug 25, 2016 4:45:38 PM__ Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
__Aug 25, 2016 4:14:20 PM__ Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!

__Aug 14, 2016 9:34:25 PM__ Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
__Aug 14, 2016 8:07:43 PM__ "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!
__Aug 14, 2016 7:57:37 PM__ I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
__Aug 14, 2016 1:06:20 PM__ It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
__Aug 14, 2016 12:55:07 PM__ I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
__Aug 14, 2016 12:50:51 PM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
__Aug 14, 2016 8:46:17 AM__ My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
__Aug 14, 2016 8:37:37 AM__ If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%
__Aug 14, 2016 8:31:23 AM__ The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said
__Aug 14, 2016 8:24:48 AM__ The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!

__Jul 30, 2016 3:55:26 PM__ Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings
__Jul 30, 2016 2:34:54 PM__ #CrookedHillary https://t.co/xyoPFJmByp
__Jul 30, 2016 2:07:07 PM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!
__Jul 30, 2016 2:06:17 PM__ Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
__Jul 30, 2016 1:45:32 PM__ I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal! https://t.co/fUTugI2R2k [Twitter Ads]

__Jul 30, 2016 8:54:44 AM__ Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.
__Jul 30, 2016 8:53:39 AM__ Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.

__Jul 29, 2016 10:14:25 AM__ Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!
__Jul 29, 2016 10:06:38 AM__ If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town! #NeverHillary

__Jul 29, 2016 8:51:13 AM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!
__Jul 29, 2016 8:40:10 AM__ The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
__Jul 28, 2016 11:59:04 PM__ No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
__Jul 28, 2016 11:57:06 PM__ Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
__Jul 28, 2016 11:54:22 PM__ Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
__Jul 28, 2016 11:52:46 PM__ Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
__Jul 28, 2016 11:50:59 PM__ Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
__Jul 28, 2016 11:47:56 PM__ Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

__Jul 27, 2016 9:01:03 AM__ Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
__Jul 27, 2016 8:57:20 AM__ Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!
__Jul 27, 2016 6:08:35 AM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
__Jul 27, 2016 6:01:39 AM__ Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
__Jul 27, 2016 5:50:55 AM__ The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
__Jul 27, 2016 5:43:16 AM__ Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!
__Jul 27, 2016 5:33:52 AM__ As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.

__Jul 26, 2016 8:38:27 AM__ Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
__Jul 26, 2016 8:34:19 AM__ Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference
__Jul 25, 2016 11:19:38 PM__ Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
__Jul 25, 2016 11:12:57 PM__ Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
__Jul 25, 2016 11:04:56 PM__ Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
__Jul 25, 2016 10:14:29 PM__ If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
__Jul 25, 2016 5:57:14 PM__ I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
__Jul 25, 2016 5:45:54 PM__ Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
__Jul 25, 2016 5:33:49 PM__ While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
__Jul 25, 2016 5:32:59 PM__ Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

__Jul 25, 2016 9:47:45 AM__ Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
__Jul 25, 2016 9:42:55 AM__ Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
__Jul 25, 2016 9:19:18 AM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.
__Jul 25, 2016 8:27:35 AM__ If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
__Jul 25, 2016 8:26:56 AM__ Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam [Twitter for iPad]
__Jul 25, 2016 8:02:01 AM__ Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
__Jul 25, 2016 7:57:17 AM__ How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!
__Jul 25, 2016 7:31:22 AM__ The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me
__Jul 24, 2016 7:59:10 PM__ Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!
__Jul 24, 2016 7:47:08 PM__ The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!
__Jul 24, 2016 6:33:42 PM__ The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
__Jul 24, 2016 6:16:59 PM__ The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
__Jul 24, 2016 6:07:49 PM__ Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
__Jul 24, 2016 6:02:42 PM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
__Jul 24, 2016 5:53:29 PM__ If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild
__Jul 24, 2016 4:45:31 PM__ The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
__Jul 24, 2016 4:30:06 PM__ I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
__Jul 24, 2016 4:20:57 PM__ Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)
__Jul 24, 2016 9:30:59 AM__ Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
__Jul 24, 2016 9:27:56 AM__ There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
__Jul 24, 2016 8:30:15 AM__ An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
__Jul 24, 2016 8:15:51 AM__ Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
__Jul 24, 2016 7:56:43 AM__ Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
__Jul 24, 2016 7:25:06 AM__ Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
__Jul 24, 2016 7:16:15 AM__ The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

__Jul 23, 2016 4:43:33 PM__ Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
__Jul 23, 2016 12:06:15 PM__ I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
__Jul 23, 2016 11:36:41 AM__ Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
__Jul 23, 2016 11:01:48 AM__ Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
__Jul 23, 2016 10:51:32 AM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
__Jul 23, 2016 6:55:20 AM__ Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
__Jul 23, 2016 6:42:10 AM__ Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
__Jul 23, 2016 6:35:37 AM__ Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
__Jul 23, 2016 6:31:18 AM__ The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
__Jul 22, 2016 11:56:38 PM__ "@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain"
__Jul 22, 2016 11:49:04 PM__ I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
__Jul 22, 2016 11:23:15 PM__ Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?

__Jul 20, 2016 11:36:06 AM__ The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
__Jul 20, 2016 11:31:15 AM__ Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
__Jul 20, 2016 8:51:58 AM__ In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!

__Jul 17, 2016 8:14:46 AM__ I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!

__Jul 6, 2016 9:08:44 AM__ I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
__Jul 6, 2016 8:31:27 AM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!

__Jul 6, 2016 7:21:34 AM__ Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
__Jul 6, 2016 7:12:45 AM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!
__Jul 6, 2016 12:36:31 AM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
__Jul 6, 2016 12:30:04 AM__ I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out!
__Jul 6, 2016 12:23:03 AM__ Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win

__Jul 4, 2016 11:34:15 AM__ With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
__Jul 4, 2016 11:26:56 AM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?
__Jul 4, 2016 10:25:04 AM__ The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!

__Jul 4, 2016 9:42:16 AM__ Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!

__Jul 3, 2016 5:46:58 PM__ I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
__Jul 3, 2016 5:43:25 PM__ The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures."
__Jul 3, 2016 5:38:20 PM__ Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
__Jul 3, 2016 5:00:39 PM__ "THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"

__Jul 3, 2016 4:16:23 PM__ Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
__Jul 3, 2016 1:40:49 PM__ Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!
__Jul 2, 2016 5:13:02 PM__ It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
__Jul 2, 2016 4:39:39 PM__ It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

__Jul 1, 2016 8:12:48 AM__ Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
__Jul 1, 2016 8:12:06 AM__ Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
__Jul 1, 2016 8:11:41 AM__ As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!

__Jun 22, 2016 3:00:47 PM__ Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou

__Jun 21, 2016 11:16:27 PM__ Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
__Jun 21, 2016 4:44:00 PM__ I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET
__Jun 21, 2016 1:19:22 PM__ Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest.
__Jun 21, 2016 1:17:49 PM__ If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.
__Jun 21, 2016 1:16:14 PM__ Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
__Jun 21, 2016 12:55:41 PM__ I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.

__Jun 21, 2016 12:38:07 PM__ Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs.
__Jun 21, 2016 12:36:40 PM__ Hillary says this election is about judgment. She's right. Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.
__Jun 21, 2016 10:22:08 AM__ I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
__Jun 21, 2016 6:38:49 AM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!
__Jun 20, 2016 6:24:12 AM__ When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees

__Jun 5, 2016 6:15:01 PM__ Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!
__Jun 5, 2016 5:56:01 PM__ I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie!

__May 6, 2016 10:44:54 PM__ Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?
__May 6, 2016 10:44:44 PM__ Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
__May 6, 2016 8:16:31 PM__ Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
__May 6, 2016 8:14:54 PM__ Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
__May 6, 2016 7:16:36 PM__ Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
__May 6, 2016 7:16:17 PM__ Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!

__Apr 25, 2016 12:15:58 PM__ Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
__Apr 25, 2016 7:59:06 AM__ Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
__Apr 25, 2016 7:54:21 AM__ Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
__Apr 24, 2016 11:49:17 PM__ Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
__Apr 24, 2016 11:39:58 PM__ Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
__Apr 24, 2016 9:27:12 PM__ I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!

__Apr 21, 2016 6:16:27 PM__ Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
__Apr 21, 2016 5:47:21 PM__ Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
__Apr 21, 2016 6:22:03 AM__ Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!

__Mar 15, 2016 12:03:57 PM__ In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
__Mar 15, 2016 11:03:34 AM__ Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
__Mar 15, 2016 10:53:41 AM__ Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.

__Mar 15, 2016 6:39:06 AM__ Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!

__Mar 15, 2016 12:21:20 AM__ Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
__Mar 15, 2016 12:10:00 AM__ Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!

__Feb 11, 2016 8:44:06 PM__ Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ @RealBenCarson. How can he preach Christian values? https://t.co/p3yGL02ABA
__Feb 11, 2016 7:19:33 PM__ "@truthinvest: @CNN @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Ted Cruz is the definition of sleaze. Just ask @RealBenCarson"
__Feb 11, 2016 7:03:54 PM__ Heading to Baton Rouge, Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
__Feb 11, 2016 4:39:33 PM__ We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching!
__Feb 11, 2016 3:45:59 PM__ Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!
__Feb 11, 2016 12:51:04 PM__ He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
__Feb 11, 2016 12:14:10 PM__ Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT
__Feb 11, 2016 11:40:04 AM__ .@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize!
__Feb 11, 2016 11:11:56 AM__ Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!
__Feb 11, 2016 10:13:09 AM__ There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!
__Feb 10, 2016 10:51:40 PM__ I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!

__Feb 10, 2016 9:34:25 PM__ I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.
__Feb 10, 2016 7:49:21 PM__ Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd!
__Feb 10, 2016 11:22:51 AM__ So funny, Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment!
__Feb 10, 2016 9:37:25 AM__ Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.
__Feb 10, 2016 9:00:20 AM__ Like the worthless @NYDailyNews, looks like @politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money, no cred!

__Feb 9, 2016 5:40:19 PM__ ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our "leader" - If I win it will be a very different story,with very fast results

__Feb 9, 2016 8:16:37 AM__ No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!
__Feb 9, 2016 8:08:19 AM__ I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!
__Feb 9, 2016 8:00:30 AM__ Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!

__Feb 3, 2016 10:21:03 AM__ And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!
__Feb 3, 2016 10:10:53 AM__ The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
__Feb 3, 2016 10:07:25 AM__ Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
__Feb 3, 2016 9:56:48 AM__ During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
__Feb 3, 2016 9:47:33 AM__ Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

__Jan 31, 2016 10:44:00 AM__ I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos this morning. ENJOY!
__Jan 31, 2016 10:40:25 AM__ If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000.
__Jan 31, 2016 10:32:03 AM__ By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS.
__Jan 31, 2016 10:22:35 AM__ Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies!
__Jan 31, 2016 9:16:37 AM__ Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam!
__Jan 31, 2016 9:06:25 AM__ Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!
__Jan 31, 2016 8:49:34 AM__ I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!

__Jan 31, 2016 8:36:39 AM__ .@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends
__Jan 31, 2016 8:31:03 AM__ .@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!
__Jan 31, 2016 8:22:48 AM__ The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!

__Jan 29, 2016 9:31:51 PM__ .@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS.
__Jan 29, 2016 9:25:17 PM__ Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator is endorsing Canada Ted!
__Jan 29, 2016 9:15:43 PM__ .@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected? @greta
__Jan 29, 2016 9:10:56 PM__ The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.
__Jan 29, 2016 7:51:34 PM__ The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

__Jan 16, 2016 3:39:31 PM__ Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? https://t.co/rYGX9vazku
__Jan 16, 2016 3:32:40 PM__ Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite
__Jan 16, 2016 2:31:39 PM__ Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you! https://t.co/m98wooUwsG https://t.co/izBMhEZolh
__Jan 16, 2016 2:26:54 PM__ Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
__Jan 16, 2016 2:23:26 PM__ When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
__Jan 16, 2016 2:22:40 PM__ Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
__Jan 16, 2016 2:21:03 PM__ If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
__Jan 16, 2016 12:11:28 PM__ Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes. https://t.co/hxdfy0mjVw

__Jan 16, 2016 9:31:10 AM__ Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
__Jan 16, 2016 8:23:00 AM__ Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?
__Jan 16, 2016 8:17:32 AM__ Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
__Jan 16, 2016 8:12:45 AM__ The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
__Jan 16, 2016 7:52:46 AM__ Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
__Jan 16, 2016 7:49:02 AM__ Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
__Jan 16, 2016 7:40:13 AM__ Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
__Jan 15, 2016 10:47:22 PM__ More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.

__Dec 25, 2015 5:49:30 PM__ The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.
__Dec 25, 2015 5:42:39 PM__ .@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!
__Dec 25, 2015 5:11:23 PM__ @CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!

__Dec 25, 2015 4:45:06 PM__ When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say "we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!
__Dec 25, 2015 4:31:40 PM__ Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!
__Dec 25, 2015 4:24:41 PM__ Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.
__Dec 25, 2015 4:15:25 PM__ We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
__Dec 25, 2015 4:11:18 PM__ Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!
__Dec 25, 2015 3:38:17 PM__ .@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!
__Dec 24, 2015 10:55:58 PM__ Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done!
__Dec 24, 2015 10:22:42 PM__ .@danielhalper Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed!
__Dec 24, 2015 9:56:08 PM__ .@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!
__Dec 24, 2015 9:50:38 PM__ "@YesMrGilbert: @NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story" True, a total distortion of the facts!

__Dec 24, 2015 7:04:08 PM__ .@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!
__Dec 24, 2015 6:56:55 PM__ Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!
__Dec 24, 2015 6:42:10 PM__ Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!
__Dec 24, 2015 6:35:38 PM__ Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly
__Dec 24, 2015 6:31:41 PM__ Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!
__Dec 24, 2015 6:20:24 PM__ Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!
__Dec 24, 2015 6:14:10 PM__ In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!
__Dec 24, 2015 4:10:14 PM__ Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!
__Dec 24, 2015 4:02:02 PM__ "@classyexplorer: @gatewaypundit Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE...Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18...Big Detail

__Dec 23, 2015 11:22:59 PM__ Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity

__Dec 23, 2015 1:20:55 PM__ It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media. New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead
__Dec 23, 2015 11:55:23 AM__ Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump
__Dec 23, 2015 11:49:01 AM__ .@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!
__Dec 23, 2015 10:55:24 AM__ The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad

__Dec 23, 2015 1:48:08 AM__ It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!
__Dec 22, 2015 11:37:51 PM__ When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!

__Dec 22, 2015 8:52:12 PM__ For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged," bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM
__Dec 22, 2015 8:48:24 PM__ NPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #Hypocrisy
__Dec 22, 2015 8:47:59 PM__ Once again, #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.
__Dec 22, 2015 6:50:23 PM__ Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!

__Nov 19, 2015 9:05:54 PM__ I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money.
__Nov 19, 2015 9:05:35 PM__ John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!
__Nov 19, 2015 9:05:16 PM__ John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.
__Nov 19, 2015 9:04:55 PM__ Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.

__Sep 20, 2015 8:51:49 PM__ I have been leading big in all polls, with two more today, @nbc and @CNN. The NBC poll is more than double next, at 29%. Fiorina has 11%.

__Nov 25, 2014 10:05:53 AM__ President Obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the African American community-they have fared so poorly under his presidency.

__Nov 25, 2014 4:35:06 AM__ Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. What were they thinking?
__Nov 25, 2014 4:25:13 AM__ Our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places
__Nov 25, 2014 4:15:23 AM__ Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!
__Nov 25, 2014 4:07:45 AM__ As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!
__Nov 25, 2014 3:57:16 AM__ Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot
__Nov 25, 2014 3:45:56 AM__ If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now!
__Nov 24, 2014 11:47:14 PM__ Despite having a black president, the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a leader, this would not be the case

__Nov 24, 2014 7:51:43 PM__ Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart.
__Nov 24, 2014 7:47:00 PM__ Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
__Nov 24, 2014 5:38:39 PM__ ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.
__Nov 24, 2014 5:30:18 PM__ There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.
__Nov 24, 2014 4:48:00 PM__ Fact – Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.

_Nov 25, 2013 4:32:37 PM_ Why didn't Obama, as part of the negotiation, free the Christian Pastor Saeed Abedini? http://t.co/NRQHoDBwA0
_Nov 25, 2013 3:43:39 PM_ Obama is going to take away over 90M Americans’ healthcare plans but he is letting Iran keep its nukes. Just think about that.
_Nov 25, 2013 2:25:26 PM_ Who would you rather have negotiating with Iran--President Obama or Toronto Mayor Ford? My money is on Ford.

_Nov 25, 2013 6:49:43 AM_ John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran. Great dealmakers do not celebrate deals,they just go on to the next one

_Nov 23, 2013 9:16:05 PM_ The people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you ObamaCare!

_Nov 21, 2013 9:23:32 PM_ Weak newscasters are asking "is there a racial component to knockout attacks?" Of course there is and weakness will only make it worse!
_Nov 21, 2013 9:15:42 PM_ If you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged, and you carry a gun, shoot the bastard (teach them a lesson)!
_Nov 21, 2013 9:06:59 PM_ Knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth. We better start getting tough in this country-and they want to take our guns!
