_Dec 12, 2016 9:17:54 AM_ Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card. It would be called conspiracy theory!

_Nov 19, 2016 9:39:34 AM_ The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U. Too bad!
_Nov 19, 2016 9:34:38 AM_ I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country.
_Nov 18, 2016 6:35:27 PM_ Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

_Nov 17, 2016 10:15:28 PM_ I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!
_Nov 17, 2016 10:01:52 PM_ Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico
_Nov 17, 2016 8:46:23 AM_ My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today. #MAGA
_Nov 16, 2016 8:25:21 AM_ Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.
_Nov 16, 2016 8:17:12 AM_ I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,
_Nov 16, 2016 8:12:30 AM_ The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.
_Nov 16, 2016 7:28:57 AM_ I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children. This was a typically false news story.
_Nov 15, 2016 10:55:34 PM_ Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!
_Nov 15, 2016 9:40:29 AM_ The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!
_Nov 15, 2016 9:34:43 AM_ If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in N.Y. Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily
_Nov 13, 2016 2:46:36 PM_ The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win!
_Nov 13, 2016 12:33:26 PM_ I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P.M. Enjoy!
_Nov 13, 2016 12:03:21 PM_ The @nytimes states today that DJT believes "more countries should acquire nuclear weapons." How dishonest are they. I never said this!
_Nov 13, 2016 11:28:52 AM_ Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win. The people of Ohio were incredible!
_Nov 13, 2016 11:23:28 AM_ Jeb Bush, George W and George H.W. all called to express their best wishes on the win. Very nice!
_Nov 13, 2016 10:45:28 AM_ Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win. Very nice!
_Nov 13, 2016 10:43:09 AM_ The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me. I wonder if it will change - doubt it?
_Nov 13, 2016 10:16:46 AM_ Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena"
_Nov 12, 2016 11:05:33 AM_ This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans. We will unite and we will win, win, win!

_Nov 10, 2016 10:19:44 PM_ Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!
_Nov 10, 2016 10:10:46 PM_ A fantastic day in D.C. Met with President Obama for first time. Really good meeting, great chemistry. Melania liked Mrs. O a lot!

_Oct 16, 2016 4:54:37 PM_ Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc.
_Oct 16, 2016 4:47:23 PM_ The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton. We have Paul Ryan, always fighting the Republican nominee!

_Oct 16, 2016 1:01:12 PM_ The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD
_Oct 16, 2016 12:07:58 PM_ We've all wondered how Hillary avoided prosecution for her email scheme. Wikileaks may have found the answer. Obama! https://t.co/xF0wv8Oa8q
_Oct 16, 2016 12:07:08 PM_ Hillary's staff thought her email scandal might just blow over. Who would trust these people with national security? https://t.co/EvBCQoZRG2

_Sep 10, 2016 9:14:10 PM_ The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits!
_Sep 10, 2016 7:37:06 PM_ Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment. What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
_Sep 10, 2016 4:46:30 PM_ RT @BarackObama: RT if you agree: We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.
_Sep 10, 2016 2:18:37 PM_ While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all!
_Sep 10, 2016 11:54:27 AM_ Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad. Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass. SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER!
_Sep 10, 2016 8:47:18 AM_ Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people. I think it will cost her at the Polls!

_Sep 9, 2016 10:42:56 AM_ Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN.
_Sep 9, 2016 10:37:53 AM_ .@CNN is unwatchable. Their news on me is fiction. They are a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign.
_Sep 9, 2016 12:10:49 AM_ The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time. I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me. A joke!

_Sep 8, 2016 2:16:25 PM_ Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto.
_Sep 8, 2016 12:25:36 PM_ Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
_Sep 8, 2016 11:17:47 AM_ Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night. She's being decimated by the media!

_Sep 6, 2016 7:12:11 AM_ China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore." Terrible!

_Sep 4, 2016 7:05:24 PM_ The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake. Sad!
_Sep 4, 2016 6:05:29 PM_ The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.

_Aug 26, 2016 12:01:03 PM_ I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion. Such a big problem for our country-I will solve
_Aug 26, 2016 10:50:06 AM_ Wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @MSNBC by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @Morning_Joe. Apologize!
_Aug 26, 2016 10:20:55 AM_ What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me. Look at the poverty, crime and educational statistics. I will fix it!
_Aug 26, 2016 9:50:42 AM_ Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to solve the problems of poverty, education and safety within the African-American & Hispanic communities

_Aug 25, 2016 10:40:04 PM_ Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me. No policy, and always very short (stamina). Media gives her a pass!
_Aug 25, 2016 5:25:15 PM_ HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail, they are left w/this one tired argument! https://t.co/FNbCMmwLTn
_Aug 25, 2016 4:45:38 PM_ Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
_Aug 25, 2016 4:14:20 PM_ Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!
_Aug 25, 2016 4:11:41 PM_ Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech. Very short and lies. She is the only one fear-mongering!
_Aug 25, 2016 8:44:55 AM_ So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise
_Aug 25, 2016 8:34:58 AM_ Poll numbers are starting to look very good. Leading in Florida @CNN Arizona and big jump in Utah. All numbers rising, national way up. Wow!

_Aug 23, 2016 12:15:25 PM_ President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing. Too little, too late!
_Aug 23, 2016 10:46:58 AM_ Hillary Clinton strongly stated that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of The State Department. LIE!
_Aug 23, 2016 9:53:11 AM_ It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact, that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history!

_Aug 14, 2016 9:34:25 PM_ Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U.S.Supreme Court get proper appointments. Sad!
_Aug 14, 2016 8:07:43 PM_ "Stay on message" is the chant. I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents!
_Aug 14, 2016 7:57:37 PM_ I have always been the same person-remain true to self.The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so!
_Aug 14, 2016 1:06:20 PM_ It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
_Aug 14, 2016 12:55:07 PM_ I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process. People get it!
_Aug 14, 2016 12:50:51 PM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media. She is not a talented person or politician. The dishonest media refuses to expose!
_Aug 14, 2016 8:46:17 AM_ My rallies are not covered properly by the media. They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
_Aug 14, 2016 8:37:37 AM_ If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%
_Aug 14, 2016 8:31:23 AM_ The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change. False, I am who I am-never said
_Aug 14, 2016 8:24:48 AM_ The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened. Their reporting is fiction. The media protects Hillary!

_Aug 1, 2016 8:50:32 AM_ When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President. Already in Crimea!
_Aug 1, 2016 7:27:43 AM_ This story is not about Mr. Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U.S. Get smart!
_Aug 1, 2016 7:10:51 AM_ Mr. Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T.V. doing the same - Nice!

_Jul 30, 2016 5:51:25 PM_ Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
_Jul 30, 2016 4:01:32 PM_ I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better!
_Jul 30, 2016 3:55:26 PM_ Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings
_Jul 30, 2016 2:34:54 PM_ #CrookedHillary https://t.co/xyoPFJmByp
_Jul 30, 2016 2:07:07 PM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!
_Jul 30, 2016 2:06:17 PM_ Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
_Jul 30, 2016 1:45:32 PM_ I will write a $2 MILLION check to our campaign if we hit our million-dollar end-of-month goal! https://t.co/fUTugI2R2k [Twitter Ads]

_Jul 30, 2016 8:57:48 AM_ We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.
_Jul 30, 2016 8:54:44 AM_ Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters. Her foreign wars, NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes.
_Jul 30, 2016 8:53:39 AM_ Colorado was amazing yesterday! So much support. Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country.

_Jul 29, 2016 1:03:56 PM_ Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary. She sold them out, V.P. pick!

_Jul 29, 2016 10:14:25 AM_ Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign." Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!
_Jul 29, 2016 10:06:38 AM_ If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town! #NeverHillary
_Jul 29, 2016 9:59:42 AM_ "Little" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me. His last term as Mayor was a disaster!
_Jul 29, 2016 9:53:31 AM_ General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS. His record = BAD #NeverHillary
_Jul 29, 2016 9:44:54 AM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech. Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!

_Jul 29, 2016 8:51:13 AM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!
_Jul 29, 2016 8:40:10 AM_ The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke. @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
_Jul 28, 2016 11:59:04 PM_ No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
_Jul 28, 2016 11:57:06 PM_ Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
_Jul 28, 2016 11:54:22 PM_ Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
_Jul 28, 2016 11:52:46 PM_ Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
_Jul 28, 2016 11:50:59 PM_ Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
_Jul 28, 2016 11:47:56 PM_ Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.

_Jul 27, 2016 9:01:03 AM_ Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
_Jul 27, 2016 8:57:20 AM_ Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy. Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz!
_Jul 27, 2016 6:08:35 AM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
_Jul 27, 2016 6:01:39 AM_ Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
_Jul 27, 2016 5:50:55 AM_ The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!
_Jul 27, 2016 5:43:16 AM_ Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius." America 1st!
_Jul 27, 2016 5:33:52 AM_ As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv.

_Jul 26, 2016 3:48:08 PM_ Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
_Jul 26, 2016 3:27:58 PM_ Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed!

_Jul 26, 2016 8:38:27 AM_ Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order. The Republican Convention was great
_Jul 26, 2016 8:34:19 AM_ Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two, they are fawning. What a difference
_Jul 25, 2016 11:19:38 PM_ Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it! Waste of time.
_Jul 25, 2016 11:12:57 PM_ Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated!
_Jul 25, 2016 11:04:56 PM_ Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
_Jul 25, 2016 10:14:29 PM_ If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
_Jul 25, 2016 5:57:14 PM_ I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing. He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
_Jul 25, 2016 5:45:54 PM_ Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money. The V.P. a joke!
_Jul 25, 2016 5:33:49 PM_ While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers.
_Jul 25, 2016 5:32:59 PM_ Clinton betrayed Bernie voters. Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War.

_Jul 25, 2016 10:01:25 AM_ The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE!
_Jul 25, 2016 9:47:45 AM_ Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess. But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn!
_Jul 25, 2016 9:42:55 AM_ Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe). Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance!
_Jul 25, 2016 9:19:18 AM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all! They laughed at Bernie.
_Jul 25, 2016 8:27:35 AM_ If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same.
_Jul 25, 2016 8:26:56 AM_ Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/Pzs9uwgzam [Twitter for iPad]
_Jul 25, 2016 8:02:01 AM_ Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
_Jul 25, 2016 7:57:17 AM_ How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie!
_Jul 25, 2016 7:31:22 AM_ The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me
_Jul 24, 2016 7:59:10 PM_ Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!
_Jul 24, 2016 7:47:08 PM_ The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great. Thank you!
_Jul 24, 2016 6:33:42 PM_ The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out!
_Jul 24, 2016 6:16:59 PM_ The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
_Jul 24, 2016 6:07:49 PM_ Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!
_Jul 24, 2016 6:02:42 PM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out
_Jul 24, 2016 5:53:29 PM_ If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie), media would go wild
_Jul 24, 2016 4:45:31 PM_ The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!
_Jul 24, 2016 4:30:06 PM_ I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left!
_Jul 24, 2016 4:20:57 PM_ Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)
_Jul 24, 2016 9:30:59 AM_ Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!
_Jul 24, 2016 9:27:56 AM_ There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution." He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end!
_Jul 24, 2016 8:30:15 AM_ An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
_Jul 24, 2016 8:15:51 AM_ Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!
_Jul 24, 2016 7:56:43 AM_ Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!
_Jul 24, 2016 7:25:06 AM_ Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V.P., is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT
_Jul 24, 2016 7:16:15 AM_ The Crooked Hillary V.P. choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters. Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H!

_Jul 23, 2016 5:20:58 PM_ The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud!
_Jul 23, 2016 4:43:33 PM_ Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. ISIS and our other enemies are drooling. They don't look presidential to me!
_Jul 23, 2016 12:06:15 PM_ I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
_Jul 23, 2016 11:36:41 AM_ Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
_Jul 23, 2016 11:01:48 AM_ Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
_Jul 23, 2016 10:51:32 AM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
_Jul 23, 2016 6:55:20 AM_ Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious. RIGGED
_Jul 23, 2016 6:42:10 AM_ Pocahontas wanted V.P. slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate. Also, Crooked Hillary hates her!
_Jul 23, 2016 6:35:37 AM_ Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks. Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!
_Jul 23, 2016 6:31:18 AM_ The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for. Philly fight?
_Jul 22, 2016 11:56:38 PM_ "@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS! #MakeAmericaSafeAgain"
_Jul 22, 2016 11:49:04 PM_ I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn. How to defeat radical Islam.
_Jul 22, 2016 11:23:15 PM_ Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did?
_Jul 22, 2016 7:03:19 PM_ Another attack, this time in Germany. Many killed. God bless the people of Munich.

_Jul 20, 2016 11:36:06 AM_ The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails.
_Jul 20, 2016 11:31:15 AM_ Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press!
_Jul 20, 2016 8:51:58 AM_ In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state. Jobs!
_Jul 20, 2016 8:47:56 AM_ Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena. More than in past years.

_Jul 17, 2016 8:14:46 AM_ I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P. Then we can litigate her fraud!
_Jul 17, 2016 8:06:18 AM_ It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made. Bernie said she has bad judgement!
_Jul 17, 2016 7:55:21 AM_ As the days and weeks go by, we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions!

_Jul 13, 2016 6:26:20 PM_ Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!

_Jul 6, 2016 9:12:43 AM_ Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City
_Jul 6, 2016 9:08:44 AM_ I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies.
_Jul 6, 2016 8:31:27 AM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country. She is sooooo guilty. But watch, her time will come!
_Jul 6, 2016 8:11:03 AM_ The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but...https://t.co/KO64IAMDgj https://t.co/8CBSfNpl2l
_Jul 6, 2016 7:21:34 AM_ Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement.
_Jul 6, 2016 7:12:45 AM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information." Not fit!
_Jul 6, 2016 12:36:31 AM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
_Jul 6, 2016 12:30:04 AM_ I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder." Come November 8, she's out!
_Jul 6, 2016 12:23:03 AM_ Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win

_Jul 5, 2016 7:14:58 AM_ Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!

_Jul 4, 2016 6:30:15 PM_ Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
_Jul 4, 2016 11:34:15 AM_ With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!
_Jul 4, 2016 11:26:56 AM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails?
_Jul 4, 2016 10:25:04 AM_ The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!

_Jul 4, 2016 9:56:34 AM_ Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid!
_Jul 4, 2016 9:42:16 AM_ Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star!

_Jul 4, 2016 8:00:11 AM_ Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
_Jul 4, 2016 7:54:40 AM_ The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!
_Jul 4, 2016 7:35:16 AM_ In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!
_Jul 3, 2016 5:46:58 PM_ I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
_Jul 3, 2016 5:43:25 PM_ The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures."
_Jul 3, 2016 5:38:20 PM_ Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?
_Jul 3, 2016 5:00:39 PM_ "THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"
_Jul 3, 2016 4:47:51 PM_ On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!
_Jul 3, 2016 4:20:20 PM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!
_Jul 3, 2016 4:16:23 PM_ Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
_Jul 3, 2016 1:40:49 PM_ Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me.The good news-the people get it!
_Jul 2, 2016 5:13:02 PM_ It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said, the system is totally rigged!
_Jul 2, 2016 4:39:39 PM_ It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

_Jul 1, 2016 8:12:48 AM_ Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
_Jul 1, 2016 8:12:06 AM_ Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret. Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter.
_Jul 1, 2016 8:11:41 AM_ As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!

_Jun 30, 2016 3:30:54 PM_ The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
_Jun 30, 2016 3:30:20 PM_ I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
_Jun 30, 2016 3:29:48 PM_ The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!
_Jun 30, 2016 3:28:27 PM_ One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America. https://t.co/mO9QrmYXRD

_Jun 22, 2016 3:00:47 PM_ Hillary says things can't change. I say they have to change. It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism. #Imwithyou
_Jun 21, 2016 11:48:27 PM_ "@chrisboydbrew: @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness.. Saw your interview.You are the best! Great questions, great answers" Lou is great
_Jun 21, 2016 11:16:27 PM_ Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief! She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy!
_Jun 21, 2016 4:44:00 PM_ I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET
_Jun 21, 2016 1:19:22 PM_ Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State. She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich! Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest.
_Jun 21, 2016 1:17:49 PM_ If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens.
_Jun 21, 2016 1:16:14 PM_ Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays.
_Jun 21, 2016 12:55:41 PM_ I am "the king of debt."That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country. I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U.S.
_Jun 21, 2016 12:53:07 PM_ Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T. They have bankrupted… https://t.co/1COtt0RPY7 [Instagram]
_Jun 21, 2016 12:44:28 PM_ Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe.
_Jun 21, 2016 12:42:47 PM_ How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk?
_Jun 21, 2016 12:38:07 PM_ Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% as Secretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs.
_Jun 21, 2016 12:36:40 PM_ Hillary says this election is about judgment. She's right. Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy.
_Jun 21, 2016 10:22:08 AM_ I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton.
_Jun 21, 2016 6:38:49 AM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess!
_Jun 20, 2016 6:24:12 AM_ When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees

_Jun 6, 2016 9:15:19 AM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months. Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions!
_Jun 6, 2016 8:56:07 AM_ Just like I have been able to spend far less money than others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country. We can be great!
_Jun 6, 2016 7:23:54 AM_ People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign, but have zero access. They say what they want without any knowledge.True of so much of media!
_Jun 5, 2016 6:15:01 PM_ Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president. She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record. Change!
_Jun 5, 2016 5:56:01 PM_ I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me. Shows are predictable garbage! CNN and MSM is one big lie!
_Jun 5, 2016 5:36:48 PM_ The Clinton News Network, sometimes referred to as @CNN, is getting more and more biased.They act so indignant-hear them behind closed doors

_May 6, 2016 10:44:54 PM_ Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name?
_May 6, 2016 10:44:44 PM_ Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
_May 6, 2016 8:16:31 PM_ Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
_May 6, 2016 8:14:54 PM_ Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy.
_May 6, 2016 7:16:36 PM_ Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
_May 6, 2016 7:16:17 PM_ Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!

_May 6, 2016 2:03:34 PM_ Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work. Not much power or insight!

_Apr 25, 2016 12:16:27 PM_ On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
_Apr 25, 2016 12:15:58 PM_ Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
_Apr 25, 2016 7:59:06 AM_ Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
_Apr 25, 2016 7:54:21 AM_ Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
_Apr 24, 2016 11:49:17 PM_ Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
_Apr 24, 2016 11:39:58 PM_ Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!
_Apr 24, 2016 9:27:12 PM_ I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant!

_Apr 23, 2016 9:41:57 PM_ I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut. Looking for a big vote on Tuesday!

_Apr 21, 2016 6:16:27 PM_ Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted.
_Apr 21, 2016 5:47:21 PM_ Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify!
_Apr 21, 2016 6:22:03 AM_ Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out!
_Apr 21, 2016 6:14:48 AM_ I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully, it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M.

_Apr 17, 2016 9:38:31 AM_ Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!

_Mar 15, 2016 3:11:12 PM_ A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida? Hope this is false.
_Mar 15, 2016 12:16:16 PM_ I will bring our jobs back to the U.S., and keep our companies from leaving. Nobody else can do it. Our economy will "sing" again.
_Mar 15, 2016 12:03:57 PM_ In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22. So why would he be a good candidate? Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary!
_Mar 15, 2016 11:03:34 AM_ Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others). Kasich is weak on illegal immigration. We need strong borders now!
_Mar 15, 2016 10:53:41 AM_ Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy. Remember him in second debate, until I put him down.

_Mar 15, 2016 6:39:06 AM_ Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign. Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists!
_Mar 15, 2016 6:25:53 AM_ I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL
_Mar 15, 2016 12:21:20 AM_ Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U.S. Senate in many years. He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
_Mar 15, 2016 12:10:00 AM_ Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved. Vote Trump and end this madness!

_Feb 11, 2016 8:44:06 PM_ Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ @RealBenCarson. How can he preach Christian values? https://t.co/p3yGL02ABA
_Feb 11, 2016 7:19:33 PM_ "@truthinvest: @CNN @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Ted Cruz is the definition of sleaze. Just ask @RealBenCarson"
_Feb 11, 2016 7:03:54 PM_ Heading to Baton Rouge, Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
_Feb 11, 2016 4:39:33 PM_ We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching!
_Feb 11, 2016 3:45:59 PM_ Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance!
_Feb 11, 2016 12:51:04 PM_ He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
_Feb 11, 2016 12:14:10 PM_ Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT
_Feb 11, 2016 11:40:04 AM_ .@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize!
_Feb 11, 2016 11:11:56 AM_ Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability!
_Feb 11, 2016 10:13:09 AM_ There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser!
_Feb 10, 2016 10:51:40 PM_ I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!

_Feb 10, 2016 9:34:25 PM_ I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core.
_Feb 10, 2016 7:49:21 PM_ Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd!
_Feb 10, 2016 11:22:51 AM_ So funny, Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment!
_Feb 10, 2016 9:37:25 AM_ Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today.

_Feb 9, 2016 5:40:19 PM_ ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our "leader" - If I win it will be a very different story,with very fast results

_Feb 9, 2016 8:16:37 AM_ No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so!
_Feb 9, 2016 8:08:19 AM_ I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain!
_Feb 9, 2016 8:00:30 AM_ Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!

_Feb 3, 2016 10:28:59 AM_ Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
_Feb 3, 2016 10:21:03 AM_ And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie!
_Feb 3, 2016 10:10:53 AM_ The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz. Fraud
_Feb 3, 2016 10:07:25 AM_ Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud. Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
_Feb 3, 2016 9:56:48 AM_ During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
_Feb 3, 2016 9:47:33 AM_ Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!

_Jan 31, 2016 10:44:00 AM_ I am in Iowa. Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos this morning. ENJOY!
_Jan 31, 2016 10:40:25 AM_ If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved). Also, VETS got $6,000,000.
_Jan 31, 2016 10:32:03 AM_ By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS.
_Jan 31, 2016 10:22:35 AM_ Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels. There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace. He lies!
_Jan 31, 2016 9:16:37 AM_ Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form. Very low interest loans, scam!
_Jan 31, 2016 9:06:25 AM_ Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada). Will loose big to Hillary. Polls show I beat Hillary easily! WIN!
_Jan 31, 2016 8:49:34 AM_ I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania. After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State!
_Jan 31, 2016 8:42:28 AM_ .@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man. When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed Cruz. @foxandfriends
_Jan 31, 2016 8:36:39 AM_ .@bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event. The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself.Phony @foxandfriends
_Jan 31, 2016 8:31:03 AM_ .@bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy. Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more). I said pay and he endorsed Cruz!
_Jan 31, 2016 8:22:48 AM_ The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation." They are now under investigation. Bad!

_Jan 29, 2016 9:31:51 PM_ .@FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night. $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS.
_Jan 29, 2016 9:25:17 PM_ Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him. Not one Senator is endorsing Canada Ted!
_Jan 29, 2016 9:15:43 PM_ .@BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected? @greta
_Jan 29, 2016 9:10:56 PM_ The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator. Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective. Wants paid for pols.
_Jan 29, 2016 7:51:34 PM_ The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton. At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

_Jan 22, 2016 10:04:23 PM_ Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS. He could be Canadian Prime Minister.
_Jan 22, 2016 9:34:26 PM_ Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose. Puppet!

_Jan 16, 2016 3:39:31 PM_ Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning? https://t.co/rYGX9vazku
_Jan 16, 2016 3:32:40 PM_ Wow! Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, & $1M low int. loan from Goldman Sachs. Hypocrite
_Jan 16, 2016 2:31:39 PM_ Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm! Thank you! https://t.co/m98wooUwsG https://t.co/izBMhEZolh
_Jan 16, 2016 2:26:54 PM_ Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
_Jan 16, 2016 2:23:26 PM_ When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
_Jan 16, 2016 2:22:40 PM_ Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
_Jan 16, 2016 2:21:03 PM_ If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
_Jan 16, 2016 12:11:28 PM_ Ted is the ultimate hypocrite. Says one thing for money, does another for votes. https://t.co/hxdfy0mjVw

_Jan 16, 2016 9:31:10 AM_ Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks. They own him!
_Jan 16, 2016 8:23:00 AM_ Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks?
_Jan 16, 2016 8:17:32 AM_ Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi. Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U.S. Senate.
_Jan 16, 2016 8:12:45 AM_ The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace. Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there!
_Jan 16, 2016 7:52:46 AM_ Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file. Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand. Not much of a reformer!
_Jan 16, 2016 7:49:02 AM_ Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen. He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers.Not believable
_Jan 16, 2016 7:40:13 AM_ Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago. Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow. I told you so
_Jan 15, 2016 10:47:22 PM_ More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends! Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart. No more being politically correct.

_Jan 10, 2016 5:06:48 PM_ UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows. They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH.
_Jan 10, 2016 5:06:26 PM_ This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
_Jan 10, 2016 5:06:07 PM_ If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win.

_Dec 25, 2015 5:49:30 PM_ The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary.
_Dec 25, 2015 5:42:39 PM_ .@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary!
_Dec 25, 2015 5:11:23 PM_ @CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again!

_Dec 25, 2015 4:45:06 PM_ When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say "we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never!
_Dec 25, 2015 4:31:40 PM_ Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly!
_Dec 25, 2015 4:24:41 PM_ Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%.

_Dec 25, 2015 4:11:18 PM_ Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics!
_Dec 25, 2015 3:38:17 PM_ .@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more!

_Dec 24, 2015 9:56:08 PM_ .@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it!

_Dec 24, 2015 7:04:08 PM_ .@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck!
_Dec 24, 2015 6:56:55 PM_ Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better!
_Dec 24, 2015 6:42:10 PM_ Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time!
_Dec 24, 2015 6:35:38 PM_ Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly
_Dec 24, 2015 6:31:41 PM_ Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill!
_Dec 24, 2015 6:20:24 PM_ Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain!
_Dec 24, 2015 6:14:10 PM_ In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD!
_Dec 24, 2015 4:10:14 PM_ Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs!

_Dec 23, 2015 1:20:55 PM_ It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media. New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead
_Dec 23, 2015 11:55:23 AM_ Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump
_Dec 23, 2015 11:49:01 AM_ .@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative!
_Dec 23, 2015 10:55:24 AM_ The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad

_Dec 23, 2015 1:48:08 AM_ It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!
_Dec 22, 2015 11:37:51 PM_ When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly. The media knows this. Often used word in politics!

_Dec 22, 2015 8:52:12 PM_ For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged," bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM
_Dec 22, 2015 8:48:24 PM_ NPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #Hypocrisy
_Dec 22, 2015 8:47:59 PM_ Once again, #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.
_Dec 22, 2015 6:50:23 PM_ Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic!

_Nov 19, 2015 9:05:54 PM_ I want to do negative ads on John Kasich, but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money.
_Nov 19, 2015 9:05:35 PM_ John Kasich, despite being Governor of Ohio, is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!
_Nov 19, 2015 9:05:16 PM_ John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image, not negative ads on me.
_Nov 19, 2015 9:04:55 PM_ Governor Kasich, whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls, is going to spend $2.5 million against me.

_Oct 18, 2015 9:04:36 AM_ Jeb Bush should stop trying to defend his brother and focus on his own shortcomings and how to fix them. Also, Rubio is hitting him hard!

_Sep 20, 2015 8:51:49 PM_ I have been leading big in all polls, with two more today, @nbc and @CNN. The NBC poll is more than double next, at 29%. Fiorina has 11%.
_Sep 20, 2015 8:30:07 PM_ There is no way that Carly Fiorina can become the Republican Nominee or win against the Dems. Boxer killed her for Senate in California!

_Jun 26, 2015 12:38:33 PM_ If I win the presidency, my judicial appointments will do the right thing unlike Bush's appointee John Roberts on ObamaCare.
_Jun 26, 2015 11:13:06 AM_ .@Univision cares far more about Mexico than it does about the U.S. Are they controlled by the Mexican government?
_Jun 26, 2015 10:07:44 AM_ Anyone who wants strong borders and good trade deals for the US should boycott @Univision.
_Jun 26, 2015 10:06:22 AM_ Once again the Bush appointed Supreme Court Justice John Roberts has let us down. Jeb pushed him hard! Remember!
_Jun 25, 2015 10:27:45 AM_ I love Mexico but not the unfair trade deals that the US so stupidly makes with them. Really bad for US jobs, only good for Mexico.
_Jun 25, 2015 10:27:20 AM_ Univision wants to back out of signed @MissUniverse contract because I exposed the terrible trade deals that the U.S. makes with Mexico.
_Jun 25, 2015 10:26:52 AM_ Mexican gov doesn't want me talking about terrible border situation & horrible trade deals. Forcing Univision to get me to stop- no way!

_Nov 25, 2014 10:05:53 AM_ President Obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the African American community-they have fared so poorly under his presidency.

_Nov 25, 2014 4:35:06 AM_ Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. What were they thinking?
_Nov 25, 2014 4:25:13 AM_ Our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places
_Nov 25, 2014 4:15:23 AM_ Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations!
_Nov 25, 2014 4:07:45 AM_ As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!
_Nov 25, 2014 3:57:16 AM_ Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot
_Nov 25, 2014 3:45:56 AM_ If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now!
_Nov 24, 2014 11:47:14 PM_ Despite having a black president, the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a leader, this would not be the case

_Nov 24, 2014 7:51:43 PM_ Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart.
_Nov 24, 2014 7:47:00 PM_ Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
_Nov 24, 2014 5:38:39 PM_ ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.
_Nov 24, 2014 5:30:18 PM_ There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.
_Nov 24, 2014 4:48:00 PM_ Fact – Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.

_Nov 25, 2013 4:32:37 PM_ Why didn't Obama, as part of the negotiation, free the Christian Pastor Saeed Abedini? http://t.co/NRQHoDBwA0
_Nov 25, 2013 3:43:39 PM_ Obama is going to take away over 90M Americans’ healthcare plans but he is letting Iran keep its nukes. Just think about that.
_Nov 25, 2013 2:25:26 PM_ Who would you rather have negotiating with Iran--President Obama or Toronto Mayor Ford? My money is on Ford.

_Nov 25, 2013 6:49:43 AM_ John Kerry is openly celebrating the tenuous nuclear deal with Iran. Great dealmakers do not celebrate deals,they just go on to the next one

_Nov 23, 2013 9:16:05 PM_ The people that gave you global warming are the same people that gave you ObamaCare!

_Nov 21, 2013 9:23:32 PM_ Weak newscasters are asking "is there a racial component to knockout attacks?" Of course there is and weakness will only make it worse!
_Nov 21, 2013 9:15:42 PM_ If you are lucky enough to catch a knockout assaulter before getting slugged, and you carry a gun, shoot the bastard (teach them a lesson)!
_Nov 21, 2013 9:06:59 PM_ Knockout assaults are the new rage by sick and depraved youth. We better start getting tough in this country-and they want to take our guns!
